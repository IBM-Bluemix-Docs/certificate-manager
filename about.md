# About {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_short}}
{: #about-certificate-manager}

{{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_full}} helps you to obtain, store and manage SSL certificates that you use for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} deployments, or other Cloud and on-prem deployments.
{: shortdesc}

You can import SSL certificates that you obtain for your apps and services, store them securely, and get a central view of the certificates that you are using. Or, you can order public certificates through Certificate Manager from supported CAs.

You can manage your certificates in the following ways:

* Get notified before your certificates expire to ensure that you renew them on time  
* Use notifications to trigger automated certificate renewal  
* View the types of certificates across your deployments and ensure that they meet organization policies  
* Find certificates that need replacing when new compliance or security requirements are issued  
* Set controls on who can access and manage your certificates
* Order new public certificates
