# Monitoring activities
{: #monitoring-activities}

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstraillong}} integration to monitor ongoing activities, investigate abnormal activities, and comply with regulatory audit requirements. All requests that are made to your instance of {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_short}} are logged in {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}}.

**Note**: The information that is stored complies with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard.

For the integration to work, you must have an instance of {{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} provisioned in your account. After  the service is added, you can begin reviewing {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_short}} activities. To get started, follow the steps in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloudaccesstrailshort}} documentation](../cloud-activity-tracker/index.html#getting-started-with-cla).
