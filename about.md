{: #about-certificate-manager}

{: shortdesc}

You can import SSL certificates that you obtain for your apps and services, store them securely, and get a central view of the certificates that you are using.

You can manage your certificates in the following ways:

* Monitor the expiry dates of your certificates to make sure you that you renew them on time
* View the types of certificates across your deployments and ensure that they meet organization policies
* Find certificates that need replacing when new compliance or security requirements are issued
* Set controls on who can access and manage your certificates

## Availability
{: #availability}

{{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_short}} is available in the US-South region only.

## Private key security
{: #private-key-security}

When you import a certificate and the corresponding private key into {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_short}}, the service uses an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 algorithm to encrypt the private key. {{site.data.keyword.cloudcerts_short}} saves this unique encrypted key to use with your service instance.
