## General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
{: #compliance-gdpr}

The EU seeks to give their citizens control over their personal data by creating harmonized data protection. To do so, they use a law framework, which is known as the GDPR, to impose strict rules on those who host and process data; regardless of where they're located. The regulation also introduces rules that relate to the free movement of personal data within and outside the EU. For more information, see [IBM privacy statement](https://www.ibm.com/privacy/).
